# Compress Image python script

I´ve made this script to use it with PowerToysRun to fastly compress images, e.g. if htey are to big t ouse as a discord attachment.

After running the script or exe file you will be asked to enter the path to your image.
In quotation marks exists because if you shift + right click a image and then select "Copy as path", the path is in quotation marks.
If you are using the mode without quotation marks, you can just drag´n´drop the image into the cmd windows to give the script the correct path.
Then just press enter and the script will do its work.

**Note: the script will overwrite the original image!**
